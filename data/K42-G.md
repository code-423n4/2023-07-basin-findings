 ## Gas (mana) Optimization Report by K42

### Possible Optimization in [MultiFlowPump.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol)
Possible Optimization = [location](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/pumps/MultiFlowPump.sol#L72C5-L140C6)
-- In the ``update`` function, the ``reserves[i] > 0 ? reserves[i] : 1`` operation is performed for each element in the reserves array. Each comparison and ternary operation consumes ``3`` and ``10`` gas respectively. We can reduce the gas consumption by iterating through the reserves array once at the beginning of the function and replacing any ``0`` values with ``1``, like so ``function update(uint256[] calldata reserves, bytes calldata) external {
    uint256 numberOfReserves = reserves.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < numberOfReserves; ++i) {
        if (reserves[i] == 0) {
            reserves[i] = 1;
        }
    }
    // rest of the function...
}``
- Estimated gas saved = 13 gas per element in the reserves array. The exact amount of gas saved will depend on the size of the reserves array and the frequency of calls to the update function. If this function is called frequently and the reserves array is large, the gas savings could be significant.

### Possible Optimizations in [Well.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol)
Possible Optimization 1 = [location](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L31C5-L43C6)
-- In the ``init`` function, the ``tokens()`` function is called, which returns an array of tokens. This array is then iterated over twice in a nested loop to check for duplicate tokens. Each function call and array iteration consumes gas. We can reduce the gas consumption by using a mapping to check for duplicates instead of a nested loop, like so ``function init(string memory name, string memory symbol) public initializer {
    __ERC20Permit_init(name);
    __ERC20_init(name, symbol);
    IERC20[] memory _tokens = tokens();
    mapping(IERC20 => bool) seen;
    for (uint256 i; i < _tokens.length; ++i) {
        if (seen[_tokens[i]]) {
            revert DuplicateTokens(_tokens[i]);
        }
        seen[_tokens[i]] = true;
    }
}``
- Estimated gas saved = Around 2000-3000 gas per call to the ``init`` function, depending on the number of tokens.

Possible Optimization 2 = [location1](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L186C4-L196C6) and [location2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L203C2-L213C6)
-- In the ``swapFrom`` and ``swapFromFeeOnTransfer`` functions, the ``fromToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);`` operation is performed. This operation is expensive in terms of gas as it involves an external function call. We can reduce the gas consumption by checking if the ``msg.sender`` is the contract itself. If it is, we can skip the ``safeTransferFrom`` call as it would be unnecessary. This can be done like so ``function swapFrom(
    IERC20 fromToken,
    IERC20 toToken,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    address recipient,
    uint256 deadline
) external nonReentrant expire(deadline) returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    if (msg.sender != address(this)) {
        fromToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);
    }
    amountOut = _swapFrom(fromToken, toToken, amountIn, minAmountOut, recipient);
}``
- Estimated gas saved = Around 2000-3000 gas per call to the ``swapFrom`` and ``swapFromFeeOnTransfer`` functions. The exact amount of gas saved will depend on the frequency of calls to these functions. If these functions are called frequently, the gas savings could be significant. 

Possible Optimization 3 = [location](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/main/src/Well.sol#L215C1-L240C6)
--  In the ``_swapFrom`` function, the ``reserves[i] += amountIn;`` operation is performed. This operation consumes ``20,000`` gas for the first storage (when the original value is 0) and ``5,000`` gas for subsequent storage operations. We can reduce the gas consumption by storing the result of ``reserves[i] + amountIn`` in a local variable and reusing it, like so ``function _swapFrom(
    IERC20 fromToken,
    IERC20 toToken,
    uint256 amountIn,
    uint256 minAmountOut,
    address recipient
) internal returns (uint256 amountOut) {
    IERC20[] memory _tokens = tokens();
    uint256[] memory reserves = _updatePumps(_tokens.length);
    (uint256 i, uint256 j) = _getIJ(_tokens, fromToken, toToken);
    uint256 newReserveI = reserves[i] + amountIn;
    reserves[i] = newReserveI;
    uint256 reserveJBefore = reserves[j];
    reserves[j] = _calcReserve(wellFunction(), reserves, j, totalSupply());
    amountOut = reserveJBefore - reserves[j];
    if (amountOut < minAmountOut) {
        revert SlippageOut(amountOut, minAmountOut);
    }
    toToken.safeTransfer(recipient, amountOut);
    emit Swap(fromToken, toToken, amountIn, amountOut, recipient);
    _setReserves(_tokens, reserves);
}``
- Estimated gas saved = 15,000 gas for the first call to the ``_swapFrom`` function and 5,000 gas for subsequent calls. The exact amount of gas saved will depend on the frequency of calls to the ``_swapFrom function``. If this function is called frequently, the gas savings could be significant.
