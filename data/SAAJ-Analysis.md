# Approach
My approach towards basin audit contest was first going through code walk through video in order to understand how the codebase operations are designed.
After i went through architecture diagram to understand the logic of project, then i go to previous audit reports and automated findings of C4 in order to look for only those issues that were not find already. 
Afterwards, I started looking from bottom to find optimisation areas with also searching for vulnerabilities that may exist in any of the code snippet.
# Learning
My learning from this project is about upgrading my skill as i was unable to find any vulnerability and enhance my knowledge more deeply. 
# Comments
I understand that instead of a small project auditor needs to enhance their skill continuously in order to keep pace with the rapid advancement in the blockchain sector. As even spending around 48 hours i was not able to find any issue in medium or high category.



### Time spent:
48 hours
