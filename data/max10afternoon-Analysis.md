Due to time limitations I was able to spend very little time on this audit, therefor after understanding the scope and code base I spent almost al the available time trying to fully understand, confirm, write a script and report for an issue that I spotted during the first run through of the code, hopefully it will be of interest. 
All the analysis was done manually.

### Time spent:
5 hours
