At current codebase https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-07-basin/blob/9403cf973e95ef7219622dbbe2a08396af90b64c/src/libraries/LibBytes.sol#L23

The condition `index == data.length` is not considered with the if `branch` which may raise the gas a little bit.

2.
Since `wellImplementation` is public, it is not necessary to create a getter function again.
```
    function wellImplementation(address well) external view returns (address implementation) {
        return wellImplementations[well];
    }
```

3. 
The contract `Well` is upgradeable but missing storage gap, this could be a issue when other contract inherited from this contract.
