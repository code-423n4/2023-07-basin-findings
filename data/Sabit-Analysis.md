I looked at the codebase and how they are interconnected - especially interfaces and implementation contracts. In my findings, I could see some implementation functions are not inline with the corresponding interfaces.

For instance, the ProportionalLPToken2.calcLPTokenUnderlying. The "data" parameter is missing in the implementation contract but present in the interface contract (IWellFunction). 

When the inheriting contracts call the ProportionalLPToken2.calcLPTokenUnderlying, it will always throw an error. These have a few impacts:

Inability to Calculate Underlying Asset Values: The function helps determine the underlying amounts of tokens associated with LP tokens. Without such a function, it would be challenging to accurately calculate the specific quantities or proportions of tokens locked in LP tokens.

Difficulty in Assessing LP Token Value: LP tokens represent ownership in a liquidity pool, and their value is derived from the underlying assets. Without a function to calculate the underlying amounts, it would be more difficult to assess the value of LP tokens or determine their relative worth.

Limited Understanding of Pool Composition: The function provides insights into the composition or allocation of tokens within the pool. Without it, it would be harder to understand the distribution of tokens within LP tokens and assess the risk or diversification of the pool.

Potential Loss of Trading Efficiency: Liquidity pools heavily rely on LP tokens for trading. A missing function to calculate underlying amounts could lead to inefficiencies in trading and price discovery since market participants might have difficulty determining the exact underlying values associated with LP tokens.

Decreased User Experience: Users who interact with LP tokens and liquidity pools might expect or rely on the ability to calculate the underlying amounts. The absence of such a function could result in a less intuitive or user-friendly experience for individuals interacting with LP tokens or liquidity pools.
