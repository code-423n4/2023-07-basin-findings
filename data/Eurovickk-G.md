Gas Optimization:

Consider using the unchecked keyword from the LibMath library for multiplication and exponentiation operations in the calcLpTokenSupply function. This optimization can save gas by skipping overflow and underflow checks.
Use the unchecked keyword in the calcReserve function when calculating the reserve value. Similar to the previous suggestion, this can help save gas by skipping checks that are unnecessary.
In the calcReserveAtRatioSwap and calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity functions, use the unchecked keyword for multiplication operations to optimize gas usage.

In this updated code, the unchecked keyword is used in the appropriate locations, as mentioned in the previous suggestion, to optimize gas usage by skipping unnecessary checks. Please note that the gas savings may vary depending on the specific circumstances of your contract execution.
