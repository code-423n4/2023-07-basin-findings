Approach taken was Mannual review
All the main QA or gas issues are covered by the bot crew only
I only found that
Unused imports are used in well.sol & Aquifer.sol
better to remove them for better readablity of the code and saves some gas too
and i also seen that empty spaces are there its better to remove them
