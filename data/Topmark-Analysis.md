# Topmark Analysis Report
I analyzed the Basin code by reading the documentation thoroughly and going through the Figma file showing the code structure and I mapped out a personal Road map based on my understanding of the code setup. The Code Setup is well structured and easily understandable, which made it easy to analyzed. 
   I read the previous bug Reports, I did 15 hours of research based on general DEX setups after briefly going through the code before i proceeded to carefully go though the code to spot possible errors, it was a good audit experience.

### Time spent:
30 hours
