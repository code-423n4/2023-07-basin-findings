### Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
for high level byteReserves finding, I consider Multi Flow Pump White paper.
### Architecture recommendations
i really inspired by these two quotations:
- “Composability is to software as compounding interest is to finance.”
- “So we sailed on through the narrow straits, crying aloud for fear of Scylla on the one hand while
divine Charybdis sucked the sea in terribly on the other.”
Architecture is great, scalability is an important feature for every project.
### Codebase quality analysis
layout of codebase is perfect, but comments on codes can be improved.
### Centralization risks
as wells will be audited before, there is no centralization risk because there is no change after deployment.
### Recommendation
In Multi Flow Pump White paper in 3.1 Multi-Block MEV Manipulation Resistant Last Values formula, it can be better to add some comment that before log Xmev is unit and after log is in log.
I know that all values store in log2 but in 2 different math formulae Xmev is same before log and after log.
