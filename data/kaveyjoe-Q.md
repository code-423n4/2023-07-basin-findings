 The boreWell function allows the deployment of new Well contracts by cloning a pre-deployed Well implementation.  there is a missing check for the success of the cloneDeterministic and clone functions, which can result in failed deployments without proper error handling.

##impact 

The current issue does not pose a significant security risk, but it can lead to confusion and difficulty in diagnosing deployment failures. Proper error handling is crucial to provide clear feedback to users and developers interacting with the contract.

## Proof of concept

pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import "truffle/Assert.sol";
import "../Aquifer.sol";

contract AquiferTest {
    Aquifer aquifer;

    function beforeEach() public {
        aquifer = new Aquifer();
    }

    function testBoreWellCloningFailure() public {
        // Deploy a mock Well implementation contract
        MockWellImplementation wellImplementation = new MockWellImplementation();

        // Call boreWell with a failing clone function
        address well = aquifer.boreWell(address(wellImplementation), "", "", bytes32(0));

        // Verify that the boreWell function reverts with the expected error message
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = address(aquifer).staticcall(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("wellImplementation(address)", well)
        );
        Assert.equal(success, false, "BoreWell did not revert");
        Assert.isTrue(
            string(returnData) == "Clone failed: clone",
            "BoreWell did not revert with the expected error message"
        );
    }
}

contract MockWellImplementation {
    function clone(bytes calldata) external returns (address) {
        // Simulate a cloning failure
        return address(0);
    }
}
In the above test, we create a test contract AquiferTest that inherits from truffle/Assert.sol to perform assertions. We set up a beforeEach function to deploy a fresh instance of the Aquifer contract before each test case.

The testBoreWellCloningFailure function tests the scenario where the clone function fails during well deployment. We create a mock Well implementation contract MockWellImplementation with a faulty clone function that always returns address(0).

Inside the test case, we call the boreWell function of the aquifer contract, passing the address of the MockWellImplementation as the implementation. We expect this deployment to fail due to the faulty clone function.

We then use staticcall to retrieve the well implementation address for the deployed well. We verify that the call to wellImplementation reverts (indicating a failed deployment) and that the revert message matches the expected error message ("Clone failed: clone").
