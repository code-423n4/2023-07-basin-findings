**General**

I've spent 2-3 days on this audit and covered the code in scope. Having been audited twice by private firms, I expected there to be very little in terms of low-hanging fruits.

**Approach**

Most of the focus was on deeply understanding the assembly optimizations and particular LP mechanics, informally proving their correctness and so on. Differential analysis between Basin and Uniswap was helpful for this task.

**Architecture recommendations**

The platform supports a very generic well implementation, and as the team understands, this leads to a broad variety of malicious deployed well risks. It should be a high priority task for the team to find good ways of representing all Well trust assumptions to its users, and expose that through a smart contract UI or an open source front-end library.

**Qualitative analysis**

Code quality and documentation is very mature. The test suite is pretty comprehensive and fuzz tests are a great way to complement the static tests. My suggestion is to add integration tests to verify behavior of the system as a whole, rather than all its specific sub-components.

**Centralization risks**

None. The architecture is fully permissionless.

**Systemic risks**

MEV and TWAP manipulation are the main systemic risks. Interacting with Wells registered in the Aquifer could possibly be risky, depending on the well's configuration.

The immutability of the Pump and Well co-efficients, such as LOG_MAX_INCREASE and ALPHA, present a systemic risk as time progresses and the optimal values start diverging.

As the entire platform is unupgradeable, migration in the event of a security hole or a black swan event will be challenging. The team should prepare multiple recovery scenarios and set up adequate action channels to prepare for such eventualities.
